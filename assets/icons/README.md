# Icons in Macey

The icons used in this theme are courtesy of [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). In order to improve load times the theme uses a font containing only the glyphs it needs. This font was generating using the awesome [IcoMoo](http://icomoon.io/) service.

Below is a list of the CSS classes that represent all the icons currently in the generated font face.

* icon-rss
* icon-twitter
* icon-google-plus
* icon-facebook
* icon-github
* icon-email
* icon-linked-in

If you would like to add more you will need to first create a font using IcoMoon. Once you've done that, simply edit the [_icons.scss](https://github.com/peterkeating/macey) file adding in the codes for the new icons you've added.
